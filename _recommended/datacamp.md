[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/){:target="_blank"} offers interactive R, Python, Sheets, SQL and shell courses. All on topics in data science, statistics and machine learning. 

It is a great place to start, with a "learn by doing" philosophy.  
Their methodology include giving a bit of theory on short videos, then jumping straight to interactive exercises. The exercise interface **normally** consists of 3 parts:
1. The left pane contains text about the subject in question with the instructions for the exercise
2. The upper mid pane is where you will write your code/script (Python, R, SQL...)
3. The lower mid pane is the output console, where the result of your code will be printed out.

Here is how the interface looks like:

Many of the courses are for free, but to unlock all the content you must apply for a monthly or yearly membership.
