This is my absolute favorite beginner's Python book, it is easy to follow and actually a pleasant read. If you want to start learning Python, this is in my opinion a must read! If you do a quick search online you'll see that a lot of people share the same opinion, so don't overthink it :)


This book is split in 2 parts:
1. The first half will cover the basics (programming concepts, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and loops)
2. The second half covers 3 projects:
	1. Create your own Space Invaders 2D game using the `pygame` package  
	2. Explore the capabilities of some python packages for Data Visualization
	3. Create and deploy a web app with `Django`, called Learning Log, to be used to document what you learn about certain topics
All 3 projects are provided with a thorough explanation on every step
