title: "Exploring your Instagram data"

---

In this post I want to talk a bit about how exploring your own Instagram account and generate interesting insights.
I will be using Python for this, with the following packages:
- pandas
- LevPasha/Instagram-API-python (unofficial Instagram API)


First of all, let's login to Instagram with your account:

```python
def function():

	print('Oh hey there!')

```
