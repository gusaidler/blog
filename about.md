My name is Gustavo Saidler, and I started this blog with the intention of documenting and sharing the knowledge I acquire on (almost) a daily basis. I heard some wise people saying that writing down your work is actually an incredibly efficient way to learn new things, so here I am! 
By the way, since you are reading this, I highly recommend you to do the same!

I have a bit more than 8 years of experience in IT, from coding (Bash / Java / Python / (T-)SQL ) to administering databases (MySQL / MSSQL / Oracle)

As you will see, most of the content is related to Data Science, as it became my passion in the recent years.
To be more specific, I am focusing on the following technologies:
- Python (Jupyter)
- Spark (pySpark)
- Hadoop and its "tools"

I've recently decided to explore the data behind the apps we all use on a daily basis (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Spotify... )
There is a huge opportunity to know more about ourselves by analysing what we do and where we spend our time online, right?. Hopefully you can also get some nice insights here :)
